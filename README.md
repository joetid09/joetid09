<h1>Hi, and welcome to my page!</h2>

<p>
    I do hope you will excuse the mess on this readme. I'm currently in the process<br />
    of trying to make it more of a personal website. I'm writing it out in HTML and<br />
    will be styling it out by using svg files. For Now, Enjoy playing with the nav bar!
