👋 Hey there, fellow sleep-deprived humans! 😴 

I'm Joe, a .NET developer who's been wrangling code for a few years now.  While I've got a solid background in the .NET world, I'm currently on a mission to conquer the frontend with Vue.js (after some adventures with React and Angular).

💪  My current obsession: building an eCommerce site for CrossFit equipment that can handle even the most complex orders (because let's be honest, CrossFitters need *a lot* of gear!).  This is just the first step towards my ultimate goal: creating a nutrition-focused application to complement the gains.

🏋️‍♀️  When I'm not battling code or burpees, you can find me headbanging at my desk (much to my dog's confusion).
