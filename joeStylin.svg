  <h3>A little about my background</h3>
  <p>
      I was a cryptologic technician in the United States Navy, which is when I really realized just how cool the tech world could be. However, once I left the Navy
      I actually wound up starting a career in Customer Relations and eventually climbing the ladder up to Internal Sales for a fortune 500 company. I was 
      extremely grateful for the opportunity to have been fortunate enough to reach that level of employment, but I really just wanted to get back into a more 
      technological role. As it would happen, I was laid off due to the Covid-19 pandemic and used that opportunity to transition into a Full-Stack Development 
      Bootcamp that was being offered at <a href="https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/">Nashville Software School</a>. At the bootcamp I learned HTML, CSS, 
      javascript, REACT, C#, .NET fundamentals and actually made these apps as my capstones: <a href="https://github.com/joetid09/anythingJoes">anythingJoes</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/joetid09/GetWorking">GetWorking</a>. Once I graduated I was hired at large scale construction company, which is where I picked
      up how to build stored procedures, design data warehouses, ETL pipelines, Query tune, Microsoft Azure, MVC applications, SyncFusion framework, SSIS, and practiced
      all that I had learned at NSS.
  </p>
  <p>
      Most currently I have teamed up with my friend <a href ="https://github.com/johnhester">John</a> to build a task or todo list Hub. Our goal is to allow users to
      created notes, todo lists, and many other items that you can create with the application Joplin on your phone or computer. What is cool about that, is that Joplin also
      has an opensource server that the app can synchronize with to INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE records on a PostgreSQL database. So we are currently going through a Docker tutorial
      so that we can containerize a PostgreSQL DB and Joplin server that will be hosted locally, which we'll be updating and managing via git and docker repos. Once we get
      our database being updated by what we create in the Joplin app on our devices, well the transition over to the application itself. The current plan is to make 
      a React App with Typescript and a backend with C# on the .NET framework. The app itself will allow users to go to a single website and set up text alerts, export your
      notes to your personal calendars, as well as set the prioritization of the notes.
