<h3>A little about my background</h3>
<p>
  I was a cryptologic technician in the United States Navy, which is when I really realized just how cool the tech world
  could be. However, once I left the Navy
  I actually wound up starting a career in Customer Relations and eventually climbing the ladder up to Internal Sales
  for a fortune 500 company. I was
  extremely grateful for the opportunity to have been fortunate enough to reach that level of employment, but I really
  just wanted to get back into a more
  technological role. As it would happen, I was laid off due to the Covid-19 pandemic and used that opportunity to
  transition into a Full-Stack Development
  Bootcamp that was being offered at <a href="https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/">Nashville Software School</a>. At
  the bootcamp I learned HTML, CSS,
  javascript, REACT, C#, .NET fundamentals and actually made these apps as my capstones: <a
    href="https://github.com/joetid09/anythingJoes">anythingJoes</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/joetid09/GetWorking">GetWorking</a>. Once I graduated I was hired at large scale
  construction company, which is where I picked
  up how to build stored procedures, design data warehouses, ETL pipelines, Query tune, Microsoft Azure, MVC
  applications, SyncFusion framework, SSIS, and practiced
  all that I had learned at NSS.
